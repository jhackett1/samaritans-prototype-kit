Samaritans Prototyping Kit
=====================

**This is in a very early stage at the moment and probably isn't useful for much yet**

A minimal kit intended to make it easy to create interactive HTML prototypes.

Inspired by the great [GOV.UK prototyping kit](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-prototype-kit)
